The goal of this project is to enable anyone to create tactile graphs. This code was written by Jonas Voorzanger, a teacher in physics and computer science at Het Amsterdams Lyceum, a high school in Amsterdam. The code was not originally written to share, so please don't expect clean, well documented code.

Anyone is free to use, edit, share, copy, comment, celebrate, etc. this code in any possible way! =)
