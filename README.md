The goal of this project is to enable anyone to create tactile graphs. This code was written by Jonas Voorzanger, a teacher in physics and computer science at Het Amsterdams Lyceum, a high school in Amsterdam. The code was not originally written to share, so please don't expect clean, well documented code.

Anyone is free to use, edit, share, copy, comment, celebrate, etc. this code in any possible way! =)

# How to use the code

1. Copy the files to a local directory
2. Open `Grafiek.scad` in the free OpenSCAD software
3. This file (Grafiek.scad) includes (`use`) the two other files
4. Edit (or comment out) the functions and run the code
5. Export to .STL and use a 3D printer

Good luck!
